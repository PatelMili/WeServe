## **Project Idea**

**Project title** : WeServe - connecting NGOs to pro-bono and student volunteers

**Project description** :

In the preliminary stage when a NGO is just started, they need a lot of technical help, consulting and advising.  These NGOs do not know what resources  to apply and which best practices to adopt. They often start with paper based system and manual task which becomes tedious. Our aim is to build a platform where people and NGOs can connect for a noble cause.

**Proposed methodology** :

We intend to design a platform which would connect NGOs all around and pro-bono consultants and student volunteers who can be of some assistance to the NGO. NGOs registers itself on the platform and list the requirements that they are looking for or the kind of help they are in need of. Similarly pro-bono consultants and student volunteers registers themselves on the platform and they create their profiles where they specify area of expertise, kinds of task they are willing to do, timeline they can allocate for the work etc. We would match and connect the NGOs with student volunteers and pro-bonos using **intelligent machine learning algorithms** where we will provide recommendations of the appropriate people to the NGOs by clustering them together. The platform can be builts using **Nodejs and Reactjs**. For the **scalability of the server**, we intend to use **Kafka**.
