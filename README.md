## New ideas for reconsidreation

## **Project Idea 1**

**Project title** : Product Price Suggestion

**Project description** :

As it is considerably hard to predict how much something is worth, dealer’s need to set the prices of products considering every small detail like quality, brand name, condition of the product and so on, in deciding it’s price. The dealers must ensure that the customers feel that the product they are buying is worth the price.

Our aim for this project is to predict and suggest the prices of products to the dealer selling them online as it is necessary to set the price in such a manner that the customers would not hesitate to pay for it.

**Proposed methodology** :

In this project, **using machine learning algorithms**, we will train a model using a dataset consisting of details like product category, name, brand name and item condition to predict the price of the product which the dealer wants to launch. By doing this, setting the price for different products will become easy for large scale industries.

## **Project Idea 2**

**Project title** : WeServe - connecting NGOs to pro-bono and student volunteers

**Project description** :

In the preliminary stage when a NGO is just started, they need a lot of technical help, consulting and advising.  These NGOs do not know what resources  to apply and which best practices to adopt. They often start with paper based system and manual task which becomes tedious. Our aim is to build a platform where people and NGOs can connect for a noble cause.

**Proposed methodology** :

We intend to design a platform which would connect NGOs all around and pro-bono consultants and student volunteers who can be of some assistance to the NGO. NGOs registers itself on the platform and list the requirements that they are looking for or the kind of help they are in need of. Similarly pro-bono consultants and student volunteers registers themselves on the platform and they create their profiles where they specify area of expertise, kinds of task they are willing to do, timeline they can allocate for the work etc. We would match and connect the NGOs with student volunteers and pro-bonos using **intelligent machine learning algorithms** where we will provide recommendations of the appropriate people to the NGOs by clustering them together. The platform can be builts using **Nodejs and Reactjs**. For the **scalability of the server**, we intend to use **Kafka**.  





## Old Ideas

## **Project Idea 1**

Project title: Health Monitoring and Risk factor calculation

Project description:

To predict whether a user will suffer from a particular health problem based on user's data like BP, sleep hours, cholesterol level, average heartbeat rate, hereditary traits etc.
Additionally user can also select a particular ailment that he wishes to track or calculate the risk factor of getting affected by that ailment.
An interactive UI where the user can enter his/her own information and monitor the data via graphs.

Proposed methodology:

Use health care data set and train the model to predict what is the likelihood for a user to suffer from a particular ailment (like anxiety, High blood pressure or any other disorder). 
If a particular ailment is selected(like blood pressure, cholesterol etc.), the model will be trained using that input and risk factor of the ailment will be shown. Additionally information added by user will be shown to him/her in form of meaningful representation like graph. 




## **Project Idea 2**

Project title: Restaurant cuisine recommender

Project description:

This project is intended to help the new owners of the restaurant to identify the right location to start a new restaurant based on the food preferences of people in a particular area.
A simple attractive UI where each restaurant owner can enter his/her own detail and also the type of cuisine he/she wishes to serve in the restaurant.

Proposed methodology:

We intend to use a dataset that contains the food preferences of the residents in a particular area. Applying data analytics and data processing techniques on them, we can find out the most preferred kind of food of majority of people in a particular area. Spark and machine learning can be used to query the existing database and find out appropriate answers. 
The data containing food preferences along with its respective areas will be submitted to the restaurant owner, so that he/she can decide the right location for a particular cuisine.





## **Project Idea 3**

Project title: Safe location provider for residence

Project description:
The user enters an address where he /she wants to buy the house, the site will show the user what crime has occured in the vicinity. This will allow the users to know which locality is safer by getting the information about the crimes committed nearby in the past. 

Proposed Methodologies/Resources: 

The dataset of chicago state will be used to know what crime have occured on a particular block number. The data set will be queried via spark to determine the safe and unsafe neighbourhood. The frontend will use react js, backend will be in node js. 
The latitude longitude will be used to inform the safe location to the user.
